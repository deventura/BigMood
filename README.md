# BigMood  

Big Mood takes a snapshot of your face in real time using your face cam and inputs it into the Microsoft Azure Face API, which outputs information of your current mood in the form of a single float variable corresponding to each of the 8 mood groups.  

This was a collaborative project with Wpascuzzi from VandyHacks 2018.
